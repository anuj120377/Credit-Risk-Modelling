# Credit-Risk-Modelling
Credit Risk Modeling project to predict borrower default risk through detailed data analysis and ML.

This project focuses on predicting credit risk for loan applicants using machine learning techniques. With a dataset of over 32,000+ applicants, the aim is to help lenders assess the probability of default and make informed lending decisions.

### Project Overview - 
-> Built multiple machine learning models (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to evaluate credit risk.

-> Performed rigorous exploratory data analysis (EDA) on borrower demographics and loan attributes.

-> Applied KNN Imputation for missing values and SMOTE for handling class imbalance.

-> Achieved a best model accuracy of 93%.

### Steps Involved

-> Data Preprocessing
-> Missing value handling with KNN Imputer
-> Class imbalance addressed using SMOTE
-> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-> Univariate & bivariate analysis of borrower and loan features
-> Distribution analysis of high-risk vs. low-risk borrowers
-> Model Training & Evaluation
-> Algorithms used: KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
-> Performance evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### Results & Insights
-> Borrower demographics and loan features strongly influence credit risk.
-> Classical ML techniques with proper preprocessing and analysis can provide reliable credit risk predictions.
-> This model demonstrates a practical approach to risk-based decision-making in lending.

### Future Improvements

-> Experiment with XGBoost / LightGBM for better performance on imbalanced datasets.
-> Incorporate feature engineering with domain-specific financial ratios.
-> Deploy as an interactive web app (Flask/Streamlit) for real-time risk assessment.
-> Explore deep learning architectures (e.g., Autoencoders) for feature extraction and anomaly detection.
